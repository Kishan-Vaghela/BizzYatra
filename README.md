JAVASCRIPT [Udemy Course] - By Bharath Thippireddy

1. Introduction to JavaScript:
   - Overview of JavaScript language and its importance in web development.
   - History and evolution of JavaScript.

2. Fundamental Concepts:
   - Variables: Declaration, scope (global and local), and variable hoisting.
   - Data Types: Primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined) and complex types (object, array, function).
   - Operators: Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
   - Control Structures: if...else, switch, for, while, do...while statements.

3. Functions in JavaScript:
   - Declaring functions: function declaration, function expression, arrow functions.
   - Parameters and arguments.


4. JavaScript Popup Boxes:
   - Introduction to three types of popup windows: alert(), confirm(), prompt().
   - Implementing popup boxes for user interaction and feedback.

5. Conditional Statements:
   - Conditional (ternary) operator.
   - if...else statements for decision making.
   - switch statement for multi-way branching.

6. Form Validation:
   - Implementing client-side form validation using JavaScript.
   - Validating input fields for required fields, format, and length.
   - Displaying error messages for invalid inputs.

7. Creating Objects:
   - Object literals and properties.
   - Constructor functions and instantiation of objects.
   - Prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript.

8. Event Handling:
   - Introduction to event-driven programming in JavaScript.
   - Handling DOM events such as click, submit, change, etc.
   - Adding event listeners to HTML elements.

9. Error Handling:
   - Using try...catch blocks for handling runtime errors.
   - Throwing custom errors for specific scenarios.
   - Handling asynchronous errors in promises.

10. Debugging JavaScript:
    - Using browser developer tools for debugging.
    - Console methods for logging and debugging.
    - Setting breakpoints and inspecting variables.

11. HTML DOM Manipulation:
    - Accessing and modifying HTML elements using JavaScript.
    - Traversing the DOM tree.
    - Dynamically creating, appending, and removing elements.

12. Browser Object Model (BOM):
    - Overview of the browser object model.
    - Accessing browser properties and methods using JavaScript.
    - Manipulating browser history, location, and navigator objects.

13. Loops in JavaScript:
    - for loop: Iterating over arrays and performing repetitive tasks.
    - while loop: Executing code block based on a condition.
    - do...while loop: Similar to while loop but executes the block at least once.

14. Functions:
    - Function declarations vs. function expressions.
    - Callback functions and higher-order functions.
    - Closures and their applications.

15. Asynchronous JavaScript:
    - Introduction to asynchronous programming.
    - setTimeout(), setInterval() functions for asynchronous execution.
    - Handling asynchronous tasks with callbacks, promises, and async/await.

usage: git [-v | --version] [-h | --help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>] <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

start a working area (see also: git help tutorial)
   clone     Clone a repository into a new directory
   init      Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

work on the current change (see also: git help everyday)
   add       Add file contents to the index
   mv        Move or rename a file, a directory, or a symlink
   restore   Restore working tree files
   rm        Remove files from the working tree and from the index

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect    Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff      Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep      Print lines matching a pattern
   log       Show commit logs
   show      Show various types of objects
   status    Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch    List, create, or delete branches
   commit    Record changes to the repository
   merge     Join two or more development histories together
   rebase    Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset     Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch    Switch branches
   tag       Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch     Download objects and refs from another repository
   pull      Fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch
   push      Update remote refs along with associated objects

'git help -a' and 'git help -g' list available subcommands and some
concept guides. See 'git help <command>' or 'git help <concept>'
to read about a specific subcommand or concept.
See 'git help git' for an overview of the system.
