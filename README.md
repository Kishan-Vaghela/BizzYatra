JAVASCRIPT [Udemy Course] - By Bharath Thippireddy

1. Introduction to JavaScript:
   - Overview of JavaScript language and its importance in web development.
   - History and evolution of JavaScript.

2. Fundamental Concepts:
   - Variables: Declaration, scope (global and local), and variable hoisting.
   - Data Types: Primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined) and complex types (object, array, function).
   - Operators: Arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and bitwise operators.
   - Control Structures: if...else, switch, for, while, do...while statements.

3. Functions in JavaScript:
   - Declaring functions: function declaration, function expression, arrow functions.
   - Parameters and arguments.


4. JavaScript Popup Boxes:
   - Introduction to three types of popup windows: alert(), confirm(), prompt().
   - Implementing popup boxes for user interaction and feedback.

5. Conditional Statements:
   - Conditional (ternary) operator.
   - if...else statements for decision making.
   - switch statement for multi-way branching.

6. Form Validation:
   - Implementing client-side form validation using JavaScript.
   - Validating input fields for required fields, format, and length.
   - Displaying error messages for invalid inputs.

7. Creating Objects:
   - Object literals and properties.
   - Constructor functions and instantiation of objects.
   - Prototypes and inheritance in JavaScript.

8. Event Handling:
   - Introduction to event-driven programming in JavaScript.
   - Handling DOM events such as click, submit, change, etc.
   - Adding event listeners to HTML elements.

9. Error Handling:
   - Using try...catch blocks for handling runtime errors.
   - Throwing custom errors for specific scenarios.
   - Handling asynchronous errors in promises.

10. Debugging JavaScript:
    - Using browser developer tools for debugging.
    - Console methods for logging and debugging.
    - Setting breakpoints and inspecting variables.

11. HTML DOM Manipulation:
    - Accessing and modifying HTML elements using JavaScript.
    - Traversing the DOM tree.
    - Dynamically creating, appending, and removing elements.

12. Browser Object Model (BOM):
    - Overview of the browser object model.
    - Accessing browser properties and methods using JavaScript.
    - Manipulating browser history, location, and navigator objects.

13. Loops in JavaScript:
    - for loop: Iterating over arrays and performing repetitive tasks.
    - while loop: Executing code block based on a condition.
    - do...while loop: Similar to while loop but executes the block at least once.

14. Functions:
    - Function declarations vs. function expressions.
    - Callback functions and higher-order functions.
    - Closures and their applications.

15. Asynchronous JavaScript:
    - Introduction to asynchronous programming.
    - setTimeout(), setInterval() functions for asynchronous execution.
    - Handling asynchronous tasks with callbacks, promises, and async/await.
